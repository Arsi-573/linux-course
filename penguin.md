## End of h0

# h1 - Have to start somwhere

a) First task: Enable VT-X in BIOS
- At first I had to enable VT-X in my computers BIOS, which was a real troble.
- I then discovered the problem was, that the instruction was for Intel, and I'm using AMD with Asus motherboard. When I realized that VT-X is called SVM in this combination I have, it was a peace of cake to change the settings and then boot up my computer. 

b) Second task: Download VirtualBox. 
- I went to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and selected "windows host" to start download.
- Then I proceeded with the installation setup and after selecting the correct location for the program, I finished the Install. 

c) Third task: Download and install Debian.
- I went to https://www.debian.org/download and clicked on "debian-13.3.0-amd64-netinst.iso." to start the download. <img width="613" height="218" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb5263aa-dba1-4548-9d92-7f366824ef12" />
